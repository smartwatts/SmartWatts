# SmartWatts Product Context

## Why SmartWatts Exists

### The African Energy Reality
- **Unreliable Grid**: Frequent power cuts, voltage fluctuations, and phase imbalances
- **Hybrid Systems**: Most users rely on multiple energy sources (grid, inverter, solar, generator)
- **Limited Visibility**: No comprehensive monitoring across all energy sources
- **High Costs**: Inefficient energy usage leads to high operational costs
- **Complex Billing**: MYTO/NERC tariffs, prepaid tokens, multiple DisCo relationships

### Problems SmartWatts Solves

#### For Households
- **Energy Blindness**: No visibility into which appliances consume most power
- **Cost Confusion**: Difficulty tracking costs across grid, solar, and generator usage
- **Inefficient Usage**: No guidance on optimal energy consumption patterns
- **Token Management**: Manual tracking of prepaid electricity tokens
- **Generator Dependency**: No insights into generator efficiency and fuel costs

#### For Businesses
- **Operational Costs**: High energy bills without optimization strategies
- **Equipment Health**: No predictive maintenance for critical energy equipment
- **Compliance**: Difficulty meeting ESG requirements and energy reporting
- **Scalability**: No energy insights for multi-location operations
- **Competitive Advantage**: Lack of energy efficiency as a business differentiator

#### For Energy Providers
- **Grid Management**: Limited visibility into consumption patterns
- **Revenue Optimization**: Inefficient billing and collection processes
- **Customer Service**: Poor understanding of customer energy needs
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Lack of data for grid expansion decisions
